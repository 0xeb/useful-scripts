# Scripts

The following is a list of scripts that I've written over the years. Some of them are useful, some of them are not. Some of them are just experiments.

To install the scripts, simply run `setup.py` as such:

```python
python setup.py develop
```

And to uninstall, just type:

```python
pip uninstall useful_scripts
```

## asm_emit.py

This script is used to convert a binary file into a series of `__asm __emit` statements that can be compiled with Visual C++ / x86

## ApplyDiff.py

A simple script to apply binary patch DIF information file.
Usually, a DIF file has this format:

```
Title of this DIF file

file.bin
0000000000002B54: B0 EB
0000000000002C76: 01 17
```

Basically, seeks to `2B54` and patches the new byte value `EB` (overriding the `B0`).

## parse_vcf.py

A quick script generated by ChatGPT (following a series of prompt) that parses a VCF with multiple contacts and extracts the individual contacts

## html_entities.py

This script simply escapes HTML entities in a given source file


## mdcomdec.py

Markdown decompose/recompose script.

It works in two modes: decompose and compose.

In decompose mode, it takes a single Markdown file and breaks it into multiple files
In compose mode, it takes a folder with multiple Markdown files and combines them into a single file

## markdown_render.py

This is a simple script that renders a Markdown file into HTML on localhost.
